      Imagine you have met a curious alien Bo. Bo has learned English using a dictionary on its way to Earth, and is now trying to understand how humans communicate in real life. 
      You take Bo on a walk through your neighborhood and explain to Bo how humans talk to each other.
      <br />
      In the following, you will see short descriptions of everyday scenes that you and Bo observe on your walk. 
      In each scene, one person asks a question. <br />
      Your task is to teach Bo how to <b>understand when and how people ask questions</b>,
      so you explain to Bo <b>what possible goals the questioner might have in mind when asking the specific question</b> they did in each scene.
      Please list at least three possible goals that the questioner might have in mind on each trial.
      <br />
      <br />
      Notice that there will also be simple <b>attention checking</b> trials. 
      You will recognize them immediately when you read the important text on each trial carefully -- those trials contain instructions for you to type a certain word in the textbox. 
      Please spell the words exactly as stated in the instructions. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Please respond naturally and reasonably. <br />
      Please avoid jokes, insults or otherwise making the dialogues into
      something else than simple, harmless interactions with Bo.
      <br />
      <br />
